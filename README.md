# hs-slider-project
Combining 3d printed and metal parts to build an open source motorized dslr slider.

### More Details
You can find more inforamtion about important features, and how this project was designed in this projects blog post at [https://blog.hirnschall.net/diy-motorized-slider/](https://blog.hirnschall.net/diy-motorized-slider/)

### IMPORTANT NOTE: 
due to an issue with the current pcb design v1.0 (missing trace), it is required to solder the MS1_PIN to the MS2_PIN on the A4988 stepper driver, to get 8x and 16x micro-stepping working. These pins are labeled on the slider-controller pcb.

Sorry for the inconvenience!
